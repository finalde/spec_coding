goal: "Add a /health endpoint to the Flask API"

context: |
  The API is a small Flask app in app.py. It currently has no health check.
  We need a simple GET /health that returns {"status": "ok"} with HTTP 200.

instructions:
  - "Follow the existing code style in app.py"
  - "Do not introduce new dependencies"

tasks:
  - id: add-endpoint
    title: "Add GET /health endpoint"
    description: |
      Add a route at GET /health to app.py that returns a JSON response
      with status 200 and body {"status": "ok"}.
    instructions:
      - "Use Flask's jsonify() for the response"
    acceptance_criteria:
      - criterion: "pytest passes with no failures"
        check:
          type: script
          run: "pytest tests/ -v"

      - criterion: "GET /health returns HTTP 200 with correct body"
        check:
          type: natural
          description: >
            Start the Flask app in test mode and send GET /health.
            Confirm the response status is 200 and the body is {"status": "ok"}.

  - id: write-test
    title: "Write a test for GET /health"
    description: |
      Add a test in tests/test_app.py that calls GET /health and asserts
      the response status and body.
    acceptance_criteria:
      - criterion: "A test for /health exists and pytest exits 0"
        check:
          type: script
          run: "pytest tests/test_app.py -v -k health"
